Introduction
============

ccad is a text-based mechanical CAD (computer aided design) tool.  It
is a python module you import within a python file or from the python
prompt.  Once imported, you can create and view mechanical objects.

ccad is a python wrapper of pythonocc, but pythonocc knowledge is
unnecessary to use ccad.

First, make sure you have correctly installed pythonocc, python-gtk,
python-gtkglext, and their underlying dependencies.  Then,
