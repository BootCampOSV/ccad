Description
===========

ccad is a text-based mechanical CAD (computer aided design) tool.  It
is a python module you import within a python file or from the python
prompt.  Once imported, you can create and view mechanical objects.

ccad is a python wrapper of pythonocc.  No knowledge of pythonocc is
necessary to operate ccad.

ccad was developed and debugged on Debian Linux 6.0 and 7.0.  Although
designed for Linux, OSX, and Windows, interoperability with other
operating systems is untested and therefore probably broken.

To Install
==========

Make sure you have working copies of pythonocc and python-qt4.  Then,

  tar xvzf ccad-ver.tar.gz (where ver is the version number)
  cd ccad-ver (where ver is the version number)
  python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local (as root)

Change the prefix argument to install in a different directory.

To Operate
==========

Consult the documentation at prefix/share/doc/ccad/html/contents.html

To Build (only for developers)
==============================

Update components with modifications to MANIFEST.in and setup.py.
Then,

  python setup.py sdist

**Make sure you verify changes with unittest/test_all.py before
committing.**

To Build the Documentation (only for developers)
================================================

  cd ccad-ver/doc
  python generate_images.py
  sphinx-build . html

Then, direct your browser to ccad-ver/doc/html/contents.html

Philosophy (only for developers)
================================

1. Edges are continuous lines in 3D space.  There should be no reason
   to distinguish between them and OCC curves.  Wires are collections
   of edge connections.  Faces are continuous surfaces in 3D space.
   There should be no reason to distinguish between them and OCC
   surfaces.  Shells are collections of face connections.

2. The end-user should not ever have to call pythonOCC directly.  ccad
   should handle all things someone might want to do in CAD.
